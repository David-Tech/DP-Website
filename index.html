                <h2>My top 5 anime list is superior to everyone else's</h2>
                <br>
                <p>Okay so first of all I dont really mind what anime you think are the best 5, everyone has their own taste in entertainment. Some people tend to develop a supereriority complex when discussing these types
                    of things. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion and at the end of the day if you resonate with a show more than someone else thats just your experience.

                <ul class="top5anime">
                    <li>1. Berserk(1997)</li>
                    <li>2. Death Note</li>
                    <li>3. Hunter X Hunter</li>
                    <li>4. Steins Gate</li>

            <h2>Why Berserk is at the top of my list</h2>
            <p class="animeRambles">Berserk is an anime based in the medieval times that in my opinion has one of the greatest plot twists ever. The show also has one of the best protagonists in the history of anime, 
                Guts.
            </p>
            <img src="Images/guts2.gif" alt="imgg" class="guts">
            <p class="animeRambles">The moment when the plot turns on its head is not untill the 24th episode. The entire world and storyline
            is expanded. As a watcher you build attachments to certain characters but as the show comes to an end you watch 
            everything change, and the real story begins. Berserk is a manga written by Kentaro Miura, the series has
            363 Chapters and 40 volumes. The creator of Berserk has passed away earlier this year so unfortunately, there will never be a proper ending 
            to the story. Neverless in my optinion the 1997 adaptation to this manga is the one of the best anime of all time.
